# Dual Reporting Modes: Alerts vs. Comprehensive Reports

## Overview

The injury tracker now operates with **two distinct modes** to give you the best of both worlds:

1. **Alert Mode** - Urgent notifications for new/worsened injuries
2. **Comprehensive Report Mode** - Full injury landscape with ML predictions

---

## üö® Alert Mode (NEW/WORSENED INJURIES)

**Purpose**: Catch breaking injury news that requires immediate action

**What it shows:**
- Only injuries that are NEW or WORSENED within the alert window
- Default: Last 24 hours (configurable)
- Urgent notification format

**When to use:**
- Continuous monitoring (`python monitor.py`)
- Quick checks when you need to know what changed
- Before making waiver wire decisions

**Example Output:**
```
üö® INJURY ALERT üö®
Time: 2025-10-18 14:30:00
New/Updated Injuries: 2
(Recent injuries requiring immediate attention)

üÜï NEW INJURY
   Player: Christian McCaffrey
   Position: RB | Team: SF
   Status: Out
   ...
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
# In .env file
ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=24   # Default: 24 hours
ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=168  # 1 week - see all new injuries this week
ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=999999  # Effectively infinite - alert on everything
```

---

## üìä Comprehensive Report Mode (ALL INJURIES)

**Purpose**: Complete injury landscape analysis with ML predictions

**What it shows:**
- **ALL currently injured players** in your league
- Full ML predictions (return timeline, confidence intervals)
- Injury risk scores for every player
- Backup player analysis
- News sentiment analysis
- Complete injury history

**When to use:**
- Weekly injury report review
- League sharing (your whole league sees all injuries)
- Strategic planning (who to target, who to trade)
- Injury risk assessment before trades

**Example Output:**
```
üìä COMPREHENSIVE INJURY REPORT üìä
Time: 2025-10-18 14:30:00
Total Injured Players: 41
(All current injuries with ML predictions)

‚ö†Ô∏è  OWNED PLAYERS WITH INJURIES

Team Alpha:
  ‚Ä¢ Christian McCaffrey (RB, SF)
    Status: Out
    Injury: Achilles
    ‚ö™ News Sentiment: Neutral (0.00)
    ü§ñ ML Prediction: Week 12 (42 days)
    üî¥ Injury Risk: High (72/100)
    üëâ Backup: Jordan Mason - ‚úÖ AVAILABLE
```

## How They Work Together

### Workflow Example:

**Monday Morning (Continuous Monitor Running):**
```bash
python monitor.py  # Running continuously
```
- **Alert Mode**: "üö® 2 new injuries! McCaffrey (Out), Jefferson (Questionable)"
- **Comprehensive Report**: Shows all 41 injured players with predictions
- **Action**: You see the alert, check the full report, add Jordan Mason

**Wednesday (Quick Check):**
```bash
python monitor.py --once
```
- **Alert Mode**: "‚úì No new injuries" (nothing in last 24h)
- **Comprehensive Report**: Still shows all 41 injuries + updated predictions
- **Action**: Review everyone's status, make informed decisions

**Sunday Morning (Pre-Gameday):**
```bash
python monitor.py --report
```
- **No Alerts**: Just shows comprehensive report
- **Comprehensive Report**: All injuries with latest status
- **Action**: Set your lineup based on complete injury picture

## Key Differences

| Feature | Alert Mode | Comprehensive Mode |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Scope** | New/worsened only | ALL injuries |
| **Time Window** | Last 24h (configurable) | Current injuries |
| **ML Predictions** | Yes | Yes (for everyone) |
| **Purpose** | Immediate action | Strategic analysis |
| **Frequency** | Real-time | Always available |
| **Output** | Urgent notifications | Full report |

---

## Where You See Each Mode

### Console Output:
- **Alert Mode**: Appears after "Step 4: Detecting new/worsened injuries"
- **Comprehensive Mode**: Appears in "Step 7: Comprehensive injury report"

### Files:
- **`injury_news.md`**: Always shows ALL injuries (comprehensive)
- **`injury_data.json`**: Stores all current injuries

### Summary Report:
- Shows ALL injuries
- ML predictions included if `show_all=True`
- Grouped by ownership (your team, league teams, free agents)

---

## Configuration Guide

### Default Setup (Recommended):
```bash
ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=24  # Alert on last 24 hours
```
- **Alerts**: New injuries from last day
- **Reports**: All current injuries

### Aggressive Setup (Don't Miss Anything):
```bash
ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=168  # Alert on last week
```
- **Alerts**: All new injuries from last 7 days
- **Reports**: All current injuries

### League-Wide Dashboard Setup:
```bash
ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=999999  # Effectively infinite
```
- **Alerts**: Every single injury (use with caution)
- **Reports**: All current injuries
- Good for shared dashboards where you want to see everything

### Conservative Setup (Only Critical):
```bash
ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=6  # Last 6 hours only
```
- **Alerts**: Very recent injuries only
- **Reports**: Still shows all injuries
- Good if you check multiple times per day

---

## Best Practices

### For Personal Use:
1. **Keep ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=24** for daily monitoring
2. Check comprehensive report weekly for strategic planning
3. Use alerts for reactive decisions (waiver wire)
4. Use full report for proactive decisions (trades, lineup)

### For League Sharing:
1. **Set ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=168** (1 week) so new members see recent context
2. Share `injury_news.md` with your league
3. Everyone sees ML predictions for all players
4. Establishes you as the analytics expert

### For Multiple Daily Checks:
1. **Set ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=6-12** to avoid duplicate alerts
2. Quick checks show only new information
3. Full report always available for context

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Typical Monday After Sunday Games

```bash
$ python monitor.py --once

Step 4: Detecting new/worsened injuries for alerts...
  Alert window: 24 hours
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  5 new or updated injuries for alerts!

üö® INJURY ALERT üö®
[Shows 5 new injuries from Sunday's games]

Step 7: Generating comprehensive injury report (ALL injuries)...

üìä COMPREHENSIVE INJURY REPORT üìä
Total Injured Players: 46
[Shows all 46 injuries including the 5 new ones + 41 existing]
```

**Result**: You get urgent alerts for the 5 new injuries, but also see the complete picture.

### Example 2: Wednesday Mid-Week Check

```bash
$ python monitor.py --once

Step 4: Detecting new/worsened injuries for alerts...
  ‚úì No new injuries to alert on

Step 7: Generating comprehensive injury report (ALL injuries)...

üìä COMPREHENSIVE INJURY REPORT üìä
Total Injured Players: 46
[Shows all 46 injuries with updated ML predictions]
```

**Result**: No alerts (nothing new), but you see everyone's status and updated predictions.

### Example 3: Sharing With League

```bash
# Set in .env
ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=999999

$ python monitor.py --once
# Generates injury_news.md

# Share injury_news.md with your league
# They see ALL injuries with ML predictions
```

## Technical Details

### How Alert Window Works:

1. **First time injury is seen**: `first_seen` timestamp recorded
2. **On subsequent checks**: Compare `first_seen` to current time
3. **If within window**: Include in alerts
4. **If outside window**: Still tracked, reported, gets ML predictions, but no alert

### Data Flow:

```
Sleeper API ‚Üí Get all injuries ‚Üí
  ‚îú‚îÄ Save to database (historical tracking)
  ‚îú‚îÄ ML predictions added (ALL injuries)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Risk scores calculated (ALL injuries)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Compare with previous ‚Üí New/worsened? ‚Üí
  ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ Yes + within window ‚Üí ALERT MODE
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ Otherwise ‚Üí Just track
  ‚îî‚îÄ Save to injury_news.md (COMPREHENSIVE MODE - all injuries)
```

## Summary

**Think of it like this:**

- **Alert Mode** = "What's new and urgent?"
- **Comprehensive Mode** = "What's the complete injury situation?"

Both modes work together:
- Alerts keep you reactive and informed about breaking news
- Reports keep you strategic and aware of the full landscape
- ML predictions help you plan for both immediate and future moves

**You always get the full picture, but alerts help you focus on what needs immediate attention.**

---

## Quick Reference

**Want urgent alerts only**: Use default (`ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=24`)

**Want to see everything**: Change to `ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=999999`

**Want weekly summary**: Set to `ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=168`

**Want hourly updates**: Set to `ALERT_WINDOW_HOURS=1`

**Always get**: Full comprehensive report with ALL injuries + ML predictions, regardless of alert window setting.
